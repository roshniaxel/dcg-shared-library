⚠️  failed to check fix mdx-to-csf

Error: ❌ Unable to determine Storybook stories globs in {}, skipping mdx-to-csf fix.

In Storybook 7, we have deprecated defining stories in MDX files, and consequently have changed the suffix to simply .mdx.

Now, since Storybook 8.0, we have removed support for .stories.mdx files.

We were unable to automatically migrate your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.
We suggest you make this change manually.

│   Storybook cannot do this automatically as removing it might break your project, so it should be done manually with care.                                                             │
